    "The approach used below is unlikely to mirror a production model, where the model will constantly be fit when new data is received.  We will compare the 2 models by taking the fitted model and using it to predict the outcomes of the test set.  We will then compare the predicted outcomes to the actual outcomes, using a set of evaluation metrics.  We will use the following metrics:\n",
